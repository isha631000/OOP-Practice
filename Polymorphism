Two types of polymorphisms-
1. Compile time : Overloading also called early overbinding
2. Runtime : Virtual functions, Overriding (used in inheritance)

In c++ by default everything in the class is private. So we make it public by writing "public:" in the start.

Code for function overloading:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class info {
  public:
    void isha ( string name ) {
      cout<<" Her name is "<<name<<endl;
      }
    void isha ( int age ) {
      cout<<" Her age is "<<age<<endl;
      }
      };
  int main() {
    info obj1;
    obj1.isha(20);
    return 0;
    }
